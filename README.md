# Mobile Architectures

This subject focused on creating mobile applications (Android and iPhone) using **Kotlin**, and **Flutter**.  

## Assignment

This subject had two assignments.  

The objective of the [first assignment](<Assignment 1.pdf>) was to develop an altered version of the [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) game, where the user needs to convert his opponent's pieces into his own, with a twist: the ability to use some special pieces. The game had to save user profiles, and their best scores on a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database.   
The objective of the [second assignment](<Assignment 2.pdf>) was to develop yet another weather application using Flutter and Dart, and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
The assignments were done in teams of three.
